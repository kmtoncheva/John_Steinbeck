  <h2 >The Grapes of Wrath</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">T</span>he Grapes of Wrath, the best-known novel by John Steinbeck, published in 1939. It evokes the harshness of the Great Depression and arouses sympathy for the struggles of migrant farmworkers. The book came to be regarded as an American classic.The narrative, which traces the migration of an Oklahoma Dust Bowl family to California and their subsequent hardships, is interspersed with prose-poem interludes that explain the wider circumstances of the world with which the protagonists contend.<br> It took courage, a pile of money and John Ford to film the story of the dust bowl and the tribulations of its unhappy survivors, who sought refuge in inhospitable California. It is an absorbing, tense melodrama, starkly realistic, and loaded with social and political fireworks. It is off to a smash boxoffice career, hot on the heels of “Gone With the Wind,” which precedes it by a few weeks into the first runs.<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032551/" id="gledai" target=_blank> Watch here.</a></p>

  <h2 id="dqsno">Of Mice and Men</h2><br><p id="textk1"><span id="s1_zelen">A</span> controversial tale of friendship and tragedy during the Great Depression
 
They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face"; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a "family," clinging together in the face of loneliness and alienation.

Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him.

"A thriller, a gripping tale . . . that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick." —The New York Times. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105046/" id="gledai" target=_blank> Watch the movie adaptation here.</a></p>

  <h2 >East of Eden</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">T</span>his 1952 novel is a book of Biblical scope and intensity. In telling the multi-generational stories of the Hamilton and Trask families, Steinbeck also tells the story of the Salinas valley, observed from afar as it changes with the passage of time. How do you know, the book asks, if you’re meant to be a good or a bad person? Is it your fate to be one or the other? Is there any point in trying to assume control of your life? As the protagonists of this expansive masterpiece (which Steinbeck himself considered his magnum opus) find themselves enacting the actions of Adam and Eve and Abel and Cain, the reader is swept along by a powerful and compassionate narrative that leaves them certain they’re in the presence of a truly great mind. In the great whirl of East of Eden, we’re gifted that breathtaking sense of seeing humanity in bird’s eye view: suddenly small, ever-striving, and deeply affecting.

  <h2 id="dqsno">Tortilla Flat</h2><br><p id="textk1"><span id="s1_zelen">Т</span>aking the form of an Arthurian legend, Tortilla Flat tells the story of another Camelot: Monterey, California. Following Danny and his group of idiosyncratic paisano friends on their many wine-fueled shenanigans, this novel accomplishes the same feat as Cannery Row: it creates in the reader a complicated affection for deeply flawed characters. Though the morality of their actions varies, it is clear that the protagonists of Tortilla Flat mean well, as Steinbeck holds them up to the light to examine the shades of right and wrong inherent in their actions. Finally, we have to note that this 1935 book makes reference to some dated racial stereotypes, a fact which detracts from its success.<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035460/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" id="gledai" target=_blank> Watch the movie adaptation here.</a></p>

  <h2 >The Winter of Our Discontent</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">T</span>he Winter of Our Discontent was Steinbeck’s final novel. It takes place in a small East Coast town, where Ethan Allen Hawley must come to terms with his personal failings, as well as the moral cost inherent in ‘rising’ in the world. Reminiscent of Arthur Miller’s plays, this novel conducts an unsettling search into the dark corners of the human soul, uncovering an inevitable sense of decline, and a disheartening discrepancy between the world’s appearance and the seedy nature of its true workings. Weighed down by his family’s once glorious past and their ambitious expectations, Ethan feels pressured in his every move. As this sombre novel walks the line between tragedy and hope, readers find themselves feeling both alienated from and reconnected to their own humanity.

  <h2 >Cannery Row</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">T</span>his short novel dispenses with the necessities of conventional narrative arcs. Instead, its purpose is impressionistic: to convey, in around 150 pages, the sense of belonging to a community — a very specific kind of community rooted in the author’s memories of his Californian upbringing. You might not think that a tale about a grocery store owner, a biologist, a brothel owner, some drunks, prostitutes, and a few lost souls in a small Californian town would move you. But you would be wrong. Lit by the long shadows of Steinbeck’s discerning narration, this humble book touches on something profound, and will leave readers sinking into melancholy-tinged nostalgia for a past that isn’t even their own.<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083717/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" id="gledai" target=_blank> Watch the movie adaptation here.</a></p>

  <h2 id="dqsno">Sweet Thursday
</h2><br><p id="textk1"><span id="s1_zelen">S</span>weet Thursday takes us back to the world of Cannery Row — but this time, our small-town visit centers around a romance, so the pace picks up quite significantly. Though sequels often disappoint, this short book is an exception: Steinbeck returns to some familiar characters with a wholesome fondness, and pays testament to the tight bonds of a small town community. Among many mishaps and accidents, the nobly well-intentioned residents of this book shine through, charming readers.<br><br>“Men do change, and change comes like a little wind that ruffles the curtains at dawn, and it comes like the stealthy perfume of wildflowers hidden in the grass.”</p>

  <h2 >The Pastures of Heaven</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">P</span>astures of Heaven, as the title suggests, is set in a fertile California valley; but though the valley looks like paradise, its inhabitants’ lives are far from heavenly. These twelve interconnected short stories operate as character sketches in a manner reminiscent of Sherwood Anderson, relating the pain and suffering of a wide cast of characters. Among them are a pair of sisters driven to prostitution, a woman dealing with mental health issues, a clerk and single dad doing his best, a father who tries to protect his daughter from too much, and a hardworking farmer on the fence about whether or not he should attend an execution. These heterogeneous stories, told with warmth and humor, all touch on these characters’ shared humanity.<br><br>“After the bare requisites to living and reproducing, man wants most to leave some record of himself, a proof, perhaps, that he has really existed. He leaves his proof on wood, on stone or on the lives of other people.”</p>

  <h2 id="dqsno">To a God Unknown</h2><br><p id="textk1"><span id="s1_zelen">A</span>nother of Steinbeck’s early works, To a God Unknown testifies to Steinbeck’s powers of experimentation. The protagonist, Joseph Wayne, sets off for California with his dying father’s blessings. There, he builds a new home by a giant oak tree, a tree he comes to feel embodies his father’s spirit. After a time of prosperity, Joseph’s brothers take notice of his pagan worship of the oak, and decide to intervene. But once the tree is harmed, a period of relentless drought begins, and the family struggles to survive. This mystical and eerie book, tinged with magical realism, asks spiritual questions related to the environment: Can humans ever really control nature? Is there a higher power behind the mysterious workings of the natural world? Are humans somehow linked to the Earth?<br><br>“He felt the driving rain, and heard it whipping down, pattering on the ground. He saw his hills grow dark with moisture. Then a lancing pain shot through the heart of the world. ‘I am the land,’ he said, ‘and I am the rain. The grass will grow out of me in a little while.”</p>

  <h2 >In Dubious Battle</h2><br><p id="textk"><span id="s1_zelen">I</span>n Dubious Battle is the most overtly political of John Steinbeck's books. Set in a California valley, this is the first of the trio known as the ‘Dust Bowl’ novels (which also include Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrath). As in the other two books in the group, Steinbeck zeros in on a community of disenfranchised workers — this time fruit pickers attempting to organize a labor union strike. Pulsing with empathy for the workers, this book tells a gripping, fast-paced story of rising tension, suspense, and danger. Aside from voicing serious concerns about industrial injustice and unrest, Steinbeck also conducts an insightful investigation into the ways in which human behaviour changes when people find themselves no longer acting as individuals, but as members of a group.<br><br>“No more lone cries came from lone men. They moved together, looked alike. The roar was one voice, coming from many throats.”</p>
